# 6.3.1 Ensure 'external scripts enabled' database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance is set to 'off' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to set `external scripts enabled` database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance to `off`

## Rationale

`external scripts enabled` enable the execution of scripts with certain remote language extensions. This property is OFF by default. When Advanced Analytics Services is installed, setup can optionally set this property to true. As the External Scripts Enabled feature allows scripts external to SQL such as files located in an R library to be executed, which could adversely affect the security of the system, hence this should be disabled.This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.

## Default Value

By default `external scripts enabled` is `off`.

"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/flagss - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
