# 1.10 Ensure KMS encryption keys are rotated within a period of 90 days (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Google Cloud Key Management Service stores cryptographic keys in a hierarchical structure designed for useful and elegant access control management. The format for the rotation schedule depends on the client library that is used. For the gcloud command-line tool, the next rotation time must be in `ISO` or `RFC3339` format, and the rotation period must be in the form `INTEGER[UNIT]`, where units can be one of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).

## Rationale

Set a key rotation period and starting time. A key can be created with a specified `rotation` period, which is the time between when new key versions are generated automatically. A key can also be created with a specified next rotation time. A key is a named object representing a cryptographic key used for a specific purpose. The key material, the actual bits used for encryption, can change over time as new key versions are created.

A key is used to protect some corpus of data. A collection of files could be encrypted with the same key and people with decrypt permissions on that key would be able to decrypt those files. Therefore, it's necessary to make sure the rotation period is set to a specific time.

## Impact

After a successful key rotation, the older key version is required in order to decrypt the
data encrypted by that previous key version

## Default Value

By default, `Application Restrictions` are set to `None`.

## Additional Information

- Key rotation does NOT re-encrypt already encrypted data with the newly generated key version. If you suspect unauthorized use of a key, you should re-encrypt the data protected by that key and then disable or schedule destruction of the prior key version.

- It is not recommended relying solely on irregular rotation, but rather to use irregular rotation if needed in conjunction with a regular rotation schedule.
