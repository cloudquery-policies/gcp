# 6.5 Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are not open to the world (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Database Server should accept connections only from trusted Network(s)/IP(s) and restrict access from the world.

## Rationale

To minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be white-listed to connect to it.  

An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0/0 which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world. Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.

## Impact

The Cloud SQL database instance would not be available to the world.

## Default Value

By default, authorized networks are not configured. Remote connection to Cloud SQL database instance is not possible unless authorized networks are configured.
