# 4.9 Ensure that Compute instances do not have public IP addresses (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description

Compute instances should not be configured to have external IP addresses.

## Rationale

To reduce your attack surface, Compute instances should not have public IP addresses. Instead, instances should be configured behind load balancers, to minimize the instance's exposure to the internet.

## Impact

Removing the external IP address from your Compute instance may cause some applications to stop working.

## Default Value

By default, Compute instances have a public IP address.

## Additional Information

You can connect to Linux VMs that do not have public IP addresses by using Identity-Aware Proxy for TCP forwarding. Learn more at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-advanced#sshbetweeninstances
