# 6.2.1 Ensure that the 'log_checkpoints' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Ensure that the `log_checkpoints database` flag for the Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to `on`.

## Rationale

Enabling `log_checkpoints` causes checkpoints and restart points to be logged in the server log. Some statistics are included in the log messages, including the number of buffers written and the time spent writing them. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_checkpoints` is `off`.

## Additional Information

```
"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
