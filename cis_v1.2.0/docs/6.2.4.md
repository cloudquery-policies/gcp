# 6.2.4 Ensure that the 'log_disconnections' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Enabling the `log_disconnections` setting logs the end of each session, including the session duration.

## Rationale

PostgreSQL does not log session details such as duration and session end by default. Enabling the  `log_disconnections` setting will create log entries at the end of each session which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and determine any unusual activity across a time period. The `log_disconnections` and log_connections work hand in hand and generally, the pair would be enabled/disabled together. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_disconnections` is `off`.

"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
