## 1.1 Ensure that corporate login credentials are used (Automated)

## Description

Use corporate login credentials instead of personal accounts, such as Gmail accounts.

## Rationale

It is recommended fully-managed corporate Google accounts be used for increased
visibility, auditing, and controlling access to Cloud Platform resources. Email accounts
based outside the user's organization, such as personal accounts, should not be used for
business purposes.

## Default Value

By default, no email addresses outside the organization's domain have access to its Google
Cloud deployments, but any user email account can be added to the IAM policy for Google
Cloud Platform projects, folders, or organizations.
