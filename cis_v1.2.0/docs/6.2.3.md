# 6.2.3 Ensure that the 'log_connections' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Enabling the `log_connections` setting causes each attempted connection to the server to be logged, along with successful completion of client authentication. This parameter cannot be changed after the session starts.

## Rationale

PostgreSQL does not log attempted connections by default. Enabling the `log_connections` setting will create log entries for each attempted connection as well as successful completion of client authentication which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and to determine any unusual connection attempts to the server. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_connections` is `off`.

"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
