# 2.2 Ensure that sinks are configured for all log entries (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to create a sink that will export copies of all the log entries. This can help aggregate logs from multiple projects and export them to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).

## Rationale

Log entries are held in Cloud Logging. To aggregate logs, export them to a SIEM. To keep them longer, it is recommended to set up a log sink. Exporting involves writing a filter that selects the log entries to export, and choosing a destination in Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Cloud Pub/Sub. The filter and destination are held in an object called a sink. To ensure all log entries are exported to sinks, ensure that there is no filter configured for a sink. Sinks can be created in projects, organizations, folders, and billing accounts.

## Impact

There are no costs or limitations in Cloud Logging for exporting logs, but the export destinations charge for storing or transmitting the log data.

## Default Value

By default, there are no sinks configured.

## Additional Information

For Command-Line Audit and Remediation, the sink destination of type `Cloud Storage Bucket` is considered. However, the destination could be configured to `Cloud Storage Bucket` or `BigQuery` or `Cloud Pub\Sub` or `Custom Destination`. Command Line Interface commands would change accordingly.
