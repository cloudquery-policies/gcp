# 6.2.6 Ensure that the 'log_lock_waits' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Enabling the `log_lock_waits` flag for a PostgreSQL instance creates a log for any session waits that take longer than the allowed `deadlock_timeout` time to acquire a lock.

## Rationale

The deadlock timeout defines the time to wait on a lock before checking for any conditions. Frequent run overs on deadlock timeout can be an indication of an underlying issue. Logging such waits on locks by enabling the `log_lock_waits` flag can be used to identify poor performance due to locking delays or if a specially-crafted SQL is attempting to starve resources through holding locks for excessive amounts of time. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_lock_waits` is `off`.

## Additional Information

```
"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
