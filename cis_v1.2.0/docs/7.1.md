# 7.1 Ensure that BigQuery datasets are not anonymously or publicly accessible (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended that the IAM policy on BigQuery datasets does not allow anonymous and/or public access.

## Rationale

Granting permissions to `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers` allows anyone to access the dataset. Such access might not be desirable if sensitive data is being stored in the dataset. Therefore, ensure that anonymous and/or public access to a dataset is not allowed.

## Impact

The dataset is not publicly accessible. Explicit modification of IAM privileges would be necessary to make them publicly accessible.

## Default Value

By default, BigQuery datasets are not publicly accessible.
