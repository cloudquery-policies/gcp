# 6.2.5 Ensure 'log_duration' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on' (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Enabling the `log_duration` setting causes the duration of each completed statement to be logged. This does not logs the text of the query and thus behaves different from the `log_min_duration_statement` flag. This parameter cannot be changed after session start.

## Rationale

Monitoring the time taken to execute the queries can be crucial in identifying any resource hogging queries and assessing the performance of the server. Further steps such as load balancing and use of optimized queries can be taken to ensure the performance and stability of the server. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_duration` is `off`.

"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
