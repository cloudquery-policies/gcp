# 6.6 Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances do not have public IPs (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to configure Second Generation Sql instance to use private IPs instead of public IPs.

## Rationale

To lower the organization's attack surface, Cloud SQL databases should not have public IPs. Private IPs provide improved network security and lower latency for your application.

## Impact

Removing the public IP address on SQL instances may break some applications that relied on it for database connectivity.

## Default Value

By default, Cloud Sql instances have a public IP.

## Additional Information

Replicas inherit their private IP status from their primary instance. You cannot configure a private IP directly on a replica.
