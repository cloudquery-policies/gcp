# 6.3.2 Ensure that the 'cross db ownership chaining' database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance is set to 'off' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to set `cross db ownership chaining` database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance to `off`.

## Rationale

Use the `cross db ownership` for chaining option to configure cross-database ownership chaining for an instance of Microsoft SQL Server. This server option allows you to control cross-database ownership chaining at the database level or to allow cross-database ownership chaining for all databases. Enabling `cross db ownership` is not recommended unless all the databases hosted by the instance of SQL Server must participate in cross-database ownership chaining, and you are aware of the security implications of this setting.This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.

## Additional Information

```
"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/flagss - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
