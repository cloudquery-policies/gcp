# 3.10 Ensure Firewall Rules for instances behind Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) only allow the traffic from Google Cloud Loadbalancer (GCLB) Health Check and Proxy Addresses (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description

Access to VMs should be restricted by firewall rules that allow only IAP traffic by ensuring only connections proxied by the IAP are allowed. To ensure that load balancing works correctly health checks should also be allowed.

## Rationale

IAP ensure that access to VMs is controlled by authenticating incoming requests. However, if the VM is still accessible from IP addresses other than the IAP it may still be possible to send unauthenticated requests to the instance. Care must be taken to ensure that loadblancer health checks are not blocked as this would stop the loadbalancer from correctly knowing the health of the VM and loadbalancing correctly.

## Impact

If firewall rules are not configured correctly, legitimate business services could be negatively impacted.

## Default Value

By default, all traffic is allowed.
