# 2.9 Ensure that the log metric filter and alerts exist for VPC network changes (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network changes.

## Rationale

It is possible to have more than one VPC within a project. In addition, it is also possible to create a peer connection between two VPCs enabling network traffic to route between VPCs.  

Monitoring changes to a VPC will help ensure VPC traffic flow is not getting impacted.

## Impact

Enabling of logging may result in your project being charged for the additional logs usage.
