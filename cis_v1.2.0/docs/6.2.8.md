# 6.2.8 Ensure 'log_hostname' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set appropriately (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

PostgreSQL logs only the IP address of the connecting hosts. The `log_hostname` flag controls the logging of `hostnames` in addition to the IP addresses logged. The performance hit is dependent on the configuration of the environment and the host name resolution setup. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

## Rationale

Logging hostnames can incur overhead on server performance as for each statement logged, DNS resolution will be required to convert IP address to hostname. Depending on the setup, this may be non-negligible. Additionally, the IP addresses that are logged can be resolved to their DNS names later when reviewing the logs excluding the cases where dynamic hostnames are used. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_hostname` is `off`.

## Additional Information

```
"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
