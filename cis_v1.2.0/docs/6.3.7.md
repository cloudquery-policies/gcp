# 6.3.7 Ensure that the 'contained database authentication' database flag for Cloud SQL on the SQL Server instance is set to 'off' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to set `contained database authentication` database flag for Cloud SQL on the SQL Server instance is set to `off`.

## Rationale

A contained database includes all database settings and metadata required to define the database and has no configuration dependencies on the instance of the Database Engine where the database is installed. Users can connect to the database without authenticating a login at the Database Engine level. Isolating the database from the Database Engine makes it possible to easily move the database to another instance of SQL Server. Contained databases have some unique threats that should be understood and mitigated by SQL Server Database Engine administrators. Most of the threats are related to the USER WITH PASSWORD authentication process, which moves the authentication boundary from the Database Engine level to the database level, hence this is recommended to disable this flag. This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.

## Impact

When `contained database authentication` is off (0) for the instance, contained databases cannot be created, or attached to the Database Engine.

## Additional Information

```
"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/flagss - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
