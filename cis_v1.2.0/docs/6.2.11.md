# 6.2.11 Ensure 'log_executor_stats' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'off' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description

The PostgreSQL executor is responsible to execute the plan handed over by the PostgreSQL planner. The executor processes the plan recursively to extract the required set of rows. The `log_executor_stats` flag controls the inclusion of PostgreSQL executor performance statistics in the PostgreSQL logs for each query.

## Rationale

The `log_executor_stats` flag enables a crude profiling method for logging PostgreSQL executor performance statistics which even though can be useful for troubleshooting, it may increase the amount of logs significantly and have performance overhead. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_executor_stats` is `off`.

"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
