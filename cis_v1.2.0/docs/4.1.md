# 4.1 Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to configure your instance to not use the default Compute Engine service account because it has the Editor role on the project.

## Rationale

The default Compute Engine service account has the Editor role on the project, which allows read and write access to most Google Cloud Services. To defend against privilege escalations if your VM is compromised and prevent an attacker from gaining access to all of your project, it is recommended to not use the default Compute Engine service account. Instead, you should create a new service account and assigning only the permissions needed by your instance.  

The default Compute Engine service account is named `[PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com.`

## Impact

None.

## Default Value

By default, Compute instances are configured to use the default Compute Engine service account.
