# 3.2 Ensure legacy networks do not exist for a project (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

In order to prevent use of legacy networks, a project should not have a legacy network configured.

## Rationale

Legacy networks have a single network IPv4 prefix range and a single gateway IP address for the whole network. The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions. Subnetworks cannot be created in a legacy network and are unable to switch from legacy to auto or custom subnet networks. Legacy networks can have an impact for high network traffic projects and are subject to a single point of contention or failure.

## Impact

None.

## Default Value

By default, networks are not created in the legacy mode.
