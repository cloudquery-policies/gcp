# 6.3.6 Ensure '3625 (trace flag)' database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance is set to 'off' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to set `3625 (trace flag)` database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance to `off`.

## Rationale

Trace flags are frequently used to diagnose performance issues or to debug stored procedures or complex computer systems, but they may also be recommended by Microsoft Support to address behavior that is negatively impacting a specific workload. All documented trace flags and those recommended by Microsoft Support are fully supported in a production environment when used as directed. `3625(trace log)` Limits the amount of information returned to users who are not members of the sysadmin fixed server role, by masking the parameters of some error messages using '******'. This can help prevent disclosure of sensitive information, hence this is recommended to disable this flag. This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.

## Additional Information

```
"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/flagss - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
