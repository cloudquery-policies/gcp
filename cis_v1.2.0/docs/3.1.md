# 3.1 Ensure that the default network does not exist in a project (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description

To prevent use of `default` network, a project should not have a `default` network.

## Rationale

The `default` network has a preconfigured network configuration and automatically generates the following insecure firewall rules:
 - default-allow-internal: Allows ingress connections for all protocols and ports among instances in the network.
 - default-allow-ssh: Allows ingress connections on TCP port 22(SSH) from any source to any instance in the network.
 - default-allow-rdp: Allows ingress connections on TCP port 3389(RDP) from any source to any instance in the network.
 - default-allow-icmp: Allows ingress ICMP traffic from any source to any instance in the network.  

These automatically created firewall rules do not get audit logged and cannot be configured to enable firewall rule logging.  

Furthermore, the default network is an auto mode network, which means that its subnets use the same predefined range of IP addresses, and as a result, it's not possible to use Cloud VPN or VPC Network Peering with the default network.  

Based on organization security and networking requirements, the organization should create a new network and delete the `default` network.

## Impact

When an organization deletes the default network, it may need to migrate or service onto a new network.

## Default Value

By default, for each project, a `default` network is created.
