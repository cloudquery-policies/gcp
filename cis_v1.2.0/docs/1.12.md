_# 1.13 Ensure API keys are restricted to use by only specified Hosts and Apps (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Unrestricted keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key resides. It is recommended to restrict API key usage to trusted hosts, HTTP referrers and apps.

## Rationale

Security risks involved in using API-Keys appear below:
 - API keys are simple encrypted strings
 - API keys do not identify the user or the application making the API request
 - API keys are typically accessible to clients, making it easy to discover and steal an API key  
 - 
In light of these potential risks, Google recommends using the standard authentication flow instead of API keys. However, there are limited cases where API keys are more appropriate. For example, if there is a mobile application that needs to use the Google Cloud Translation API, but doesn't otherwise need a backend server, API keys are the simplest way to authenticate to that API.  
 
In order to reduce attack vectors, API-Keys can be restricted only to trusted hosts, HTTP referrers and applications.

## Impact

Setting `Application Restrictions` may break existing application functioning, if not done carefully.
