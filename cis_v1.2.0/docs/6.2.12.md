# 6.2.12 Ensure 'log_statement_stats' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'off' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description

The `log_statement_stats` flag controls the inclusion of end to end performance statistics of a SQL query in the PostgreSQL logs for each query. This cannot be enabled with other module statistics (`log_parser_stats`, `log_planner_stats`, `log_executor_stats`).

## Rationale

The `log_statement_stats` flag enables a crude profiling method for logging end to end performance statistics of a SQL query. This can be useful for troubleshooting but may increase the amount of logs significantly and have performance overhead. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Default Value

By default `log_statement_stats` is `off`.

## Additional Information

```
"WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted. 

Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
 
Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
