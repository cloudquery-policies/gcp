# 2.6 Ensure that the log metric filter and alerts exist for Custom Role changes (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to Identity and Access Management (IAM) role creation, deletion and updating activities.

## Rationale

Google Cloud IAM provides predefined roles that give granular access to specific Google Cloud Platform resources and prevent unwanted access to other resources. However, to cater to organization-specific needs, Cloud IAM also provides the ability to create custom roles. Project owners and administrators with the Organization Role Administrator role or the IAM Role Administrator role can create custom roles. Monitoring role creation, deletion and updating activities will help in identifying any over-privileged role at early stages.

## Impact

Enabling of logging may result in your project being charged for the additional logs usage.
