# 6.1.1 Ensure that a MySQL database instance does not allow anyone to connect with administrative privileges (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended to set a password for the administrative user (root by default) to prevent unauthorized access to the SQL database instances.  

This recommendation is applicable only for MySQL Instances. PostgreSQL does not offer any setting for No Password from the cloud console.

## Rationale

At the time of MySQL Instance creation, not providing an administrative password allows anyone to connect to the SQL database instance with administrative privileges. The root password should be set to ensure only authorized users have these privileges.

## Impact

Connection strings for administrative clients need to be reconfigured to use a password.

## Default Value

From the Google Cloud Platform Console, the Create Instance workflow enforces the rule to enter the root password unless the option No Password is selected explicitly.
