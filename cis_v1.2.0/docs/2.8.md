# 2.8 Ensure that the log metric filter and alerts exist for VPC network route changes (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network route changes.

## Rationale

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) routes define the paths network traffic takes from a VM instance to another destination. The other destination can be inside the organization VPC network (such as another VM) or outside of it. Every route consists of a destination and a next hop. Traffic whose destination IP is within the destination range is sent to the next hop for delivery.  

Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path.

## Impact

Enabling of logging may result in your project being charged for the additional logs usage.
